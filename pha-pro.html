Stature ORM enables dramatic improvements in risk management through company-wide visibility of risks identified by a continuous improvement approach that unifies different risk management activities and the related lessons learned and best practices. <br />Stature Operational Risk Management Capabilities: <br />Management of Change (MOC) <br />Stature ORM enables Management of Change (MOC) for any level of risk and complexity by involving the right people at the right time with the right process. Stature's lifecycle approach ensures seamless integration of MOC with risk assessments to ensure correct consideration of risk, while Stature's governance capabilities ensure compliance with best practices for the initiation, evaluation, approval and start-up stages of a change. <br />Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) <br />Stature ORM dramatically improves the effectiveness of your risk assessment practices, such as PHA (HAZOP, LOPA, etc) by basing them on lessons learned and best practices that continuously evolve through Stature's closed-loop, continuous improvement processes. <br />Incident Management <br />To be effective, Incident Management (IM) needs to be tied into the broader incident prevention strategies of enterprise risk management. By tying incident management to risk assessment, mitigation, and control, Stature ensures the full lessons learned and best practices captured from an incident or near miss are saved and used across the enterprise. <br />Global Risk Registry <br />Stature ORM provides you with a central risk registry of all significant risks captured in your risk assessments. The registry is automatically produced from the risk assessment process, allowing viewing from different risk perspectives (i.e. health or safety) and thresholds (i.e. loss of life, loss of asset availability). <br />Analytics - Reports and Dashboards <br />Stature ORM ensures governance of all risk management processes through visibility of key performance indicators in Risk Assessment, Incident Management, MOC, and Action Tracking processes. Through the use of comprehensive reports and dashboards, as well as leading and lagging indicators, Stature allows you to achieve visibility into high risks at all levels of the company. <br />Lifecycle Process Management for Continuous Improvement <br />Stature ORM provides comprehensive action tracking to support risk assessment recommendations, management of change tasks, incident management activities and ad-hoc actions. This allows Stature to tie together the various risk management practices into a single, closed-loop, continuous improvement process.<br />Product Name: Stature™ Quality Risk Management<br />Stature Quality Risk Management (QRM) enables companies to improve profitability by developing and delivering high quality, reliable products faster and at less cost than the competition. <br />Stature QRM ensures continuous improvement through cross-functional collaboration, a closed-loop quality lifecycle and enterprise quality specifications leveraging the deep knowledge-base in your organization. Most importantly, Stature enables early planning and specification of quality where it has the most impact - before design. <br />Stature Quality Risk Management Delivers Measurable Business Results: <br />Reduce the Cost of Poor Quality <br />The Stature software solution helps companies dramatically reduce the cost of poor quality in their organizations by reducing repeat mistakes, proactively improving designs based on lessons learned and reducing the communication gap between departments and organizations. Features, goals, measurements and actions that were dispersed over hundreds of spreadsheets are turned into collaborative quality specifications enabling continuous improvement. <br />Lessons Learned and Knowledge Management <br />In today's global and highly competitive market your organization's knowledge of how you design, build and deliver high-quality, high-value products and processes is your most valuable asset. By providing a common vocabulary and knowledge-base for requirements, functions, failure modes, effects and causes Stature automates the development of lessons learned in a format that is easily and directly accessible to the authors of quality specifications in subsequent development cycles. <br />Accurate and Consistent Quality Planning Specifications <br />Stature's knowledge-base of lessons learned is structured in the format of your quality specifications. Information such as failure modes, effects and causes can then be transferred directly into quality specifications. As a result, Stature enables companies to create accurate, consistent quality specifications across their organization, strengthening the capture and reuse of information within new programs. The knowledge-base drives accurate specifications resulting in high-value, useable data. This cycle of continuous improvement significantly enhances your company's ability to execute and compete in a competitive global marketplace. <br />Improved Communication Across Departments and Organizations <br />A recurring problem is poor communication between engineering and manufacturing. Weak communication is the result of inaccurate, inconsistent quality specifications and the inability to share knowledge and automate processes across departments and organizations. Stature's common vocabulary enables engineering and manufacturing to align their communication and business processes by ensuring everyone is speaking the same language. Stature QRM allows previously unstructured and hard-to-relate data to be clearly and cleanly linked. <br />Cost-Effective Quality Planning <br />A comprehensive knowledge-base of experiences, built on a consistent vocabulary of requirements, functions, failure modes and effects, not only improves the quality and value of quality specifications such as FMEAs, but allows them to be created in significantly less time. This in turn drives adoption of quality planning within an organization, and improves the ability to capture knowledge and reuse it throughout your organization.<br />Service Name: Training<br />Dyadem's in-house and on-site training provides up-to-date techniques, methodologies and interactive workshops that enable participants to act as study facilitators using standard industry examples or their own examples.
