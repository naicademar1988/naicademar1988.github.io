The story takes off when the celebrations in the Ahuja family are in full swing, with the engagement of Naren and Naina’s son Uday (Ali Hassan) with Pooja (Kishwer Merchant). Pooja loves Uday to the point of obsession; she wants to own and possess him completely. Her insecurities about Uday get aggravated and go completely out of control with the presence of Anamika (Amita Chandekar), the CEO of a company that does huge business with the Ahujas. Pooja, at her engagement, sees a subtle chemistry developing between Uday and Anamika. Pooja now goes on a rampage as she wants to destroy Anamika totally, so that her love life with Uday can meet its happy end; however, Pooja realizes that Anamika is not so easy to defeat. In due course of time, Anamika becomes a favorite of not only Pooja's family but of the Ahujas too. At this point Pooja decides to go for the final kill. But the question remains that who is Anamika? Is she what she portrays to be or does she too have her own story and reasons for coming to the Ahuja family? Is she as innocent as she portrays or is this all a plan, a plan to achieve her goal and her objective? What follows is an ensuing battle to safeguard the honour and prestige of Ahuja family.</p><h2><span>Cast</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h2><ul><li>Amita Chandekar as Anamika Uday Ahuja</li><li>Ali Hassan as Uday Ahuja</li><li>Kishwer Merchant as Pooja Devan Ahuja</li><li>Aashish Kaul as Devan Ahuja</li><li>Anand Suryavanshi as Rohan</li><li>Anand Goradia as Yashwant (Babu)</li><li>Dimple Hirji as Diya Devan Ahuja</li><li>Faizan Kidwai as Sanju Ahuja</li><li>Neelam Mehra as Naina Naren Ahuja</li><li>Tushar Joshi as Naren Ahuja</li><li>Shilpa Mehta as Himani Ahuja</li><li>Mithilesh Chaturvedi as Preet</li><li>Chandni Bhagwanani as Child Anisha Ahuja</li><li>Ishaan Bhatia as Child Anish Ahuja</li><li>Sanjay Gandhi as Advocate Prashant</li><li>Shravani Goswami as Ranjana</li><li>Balwant Bansal as Mr. Ahuja</li><li>Lily Patel as Gayatri Ahuja</li><li>Varun Khandelwal as Samar</li><li>Keerti Gaekwad Kelkar as Kajal Ahuja</li><li>Amrapali Gupta as Ananya Uday Ahuja</li><li>Aashka Goradia as Vishaka</li><li>Tiya Gandwani as Maa Anandsheela</li><li>Kabir Sadanand as Samrat</li><li>Eijaz Khan as Raja</li><li>Jarnail Singh as Balbir</li><li>Gaurav Khanna as Rajesh</li><li>Anil Nagrath as Anamika and Ananya's father</li><li>Surekha Sikri as Maa Ji</li><li>Nikhhil R Khera as Dev (son in law of Ahuja family)</li><li>Geetanjali Roy as Netra</li></ul><h2><span>References</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h2><ol><li><span><b>^</b></span><span>TVR Rating's of Top DD National Programmes</span></li><li><span><b>^</b></span><span>Kayaamat News Article on Indian Television Dot Com</span></li><li><span><b>^</b></span><span><cite>'Kayamat – DD National | OptionDee.Com'. <i>Option Dee Dot Com</i>. 5 December 2015<span>.

It is the story of Prachi, an ordinary young woman who faces many extraordinary situations in life.</p><p>The story begins with the introduction of two pairs of best friends living completely different lifestyles — Prachi/Neev and Milind/Ayesha.</p><p>Brought up in the lap of luxury, Neev Shergill and Prachi Shah are oblivious to the harsh realities that people often face in life. They are the children of close friends and business partners - Pranay Shergill and Inder Shah. Neev and Prachi are simple, straightforward characters. Their childhood friendship blossoms into love as they grow up.</p><p>On the other hand, Milind Mishra and Ayesha Mehra have lived in poverty all their lives. They have learn't to stand up for themselves and know how to deal with challenging situations. They too have been in love since they were kids.</p><p>Eventually, Prachi and Ayesha meet and become close friends within a short time. Neev and Milind are unhappy with this as they can't stand their friendship. Milind believes that Prachi is too much of a spoiled little princess, while Neev sees Ayesha as an ill-mannered, disrespectful brat. Meanwhile, Prachi's brother Alaap starts a relationship with Milind's sister Sukriti. Things turn ugly between Prachi and Milind's families when Alaap humiliates Sukriti and dumps her after a one-night stand.</p><p>Prachi was about to marry a man named Varun . He turns out to be a fraud. After many problems neev and prachi are about to get married when a shocking secret comes to light on the day Prachi's father dies, which brings Ayesha and Prachi's friendship to a halt. They discover that they are paternal half-sisters. Their father Inder once had an extramarital affair with Amrita (Ayesha's mother) while he was married to Premlata (Prachi's mother). Inder abandoned Amrita and went back to Premlata for the sake of the newborn Prachi. He was unaware that Amrita was pregnant with his child, Ayesha. Amrita became mentally unstable out of misery. Inder came to know of Ayesha's existence after her birth but didn't have the courage to face Amrita again. As a result, Ayesha was raised without either of her parents being actively involved in her life.</p><p>Ayesha begins to resent Prachi, holding her responsible for the way her life turned out and for Amrita's condition. A misunderstanding created by Alaap makes Ayesha's resentment turn into hatred. She decides to make Prachi pay. She takes over the Shah family's business empire and warns Prachi that she would hurt her by making sure she and Neev don't stay together. Prachi breaks up with Neev as she had promised her dead father that she'd always look out for Ayesha's best interests. Soon, Ayesha blackmails Neev into marrying her. Shortly after they get married, Prachi finds out that her father didn't die in an accident ; he was murdered.</p><p>Milind, who had moved to Turkey to make money, re-enters the story as a millionaire. Now powerful and wealthy, he wants revenge against the Shahs for what they put him, Sukriti and Ayesha through. However, he is shattered when he finds out that Ayesha has married Neev. To teach Ayesha a lesson as well as to make Prachi pay for Alaap's misdeeds, he presents Prachi with a deal: He will help her find out who killed her father if she agrees to get into a marriage of convenience with him. Prachi accepts.</p><p>Milind and Prachi's marriage leaves Neev and Ayesha devastated. Milind uses Prachi to make Ayesha jealous, but when he's alone with Prachi he mistreats and humiliates her. However, she fulfills all the duties of a wife without hesitation and quietly puts up with Milind's misbehaviour. Slowly, Milind starts respecting and caring for Prachi. Ayesha constantly attempts to create misunderstandings between the two by making Milind believe that Prachi couldn't care less about him or their marriage. She also implies that Prachi is cheating on him with Neev. Eventually, Neev comes to know that Ayesha was the reason why Prachi ended her relationship with him. He confronts her, declaring his love while she apologizes. Milind witnesses this, which further instigates his suspicions. One situation leads to another and Milind/Prachi have a heated confrontation one night. The misunderstandings are cleared; Milind pulls Prachi into a kiss and they consummate their marriage.</p><p>Milind and Prachi's relationship continues to grow stronger. Prachi comes to know about Sukriti and Alaap's illegitimate son, Ritvik, whom Sukriti has kept a secret. Prachi brings the child home and pretends to be his mother after Ayesha claims that he is the product of Prachi's extramarital affair with Neev. This infuriates Milind and he takes the matter to court. The two nearly get divorced, but the truth comes out just in time — much to Ayesha's displeasure. She decides to get Prachi out of Milind's life once and for all, by murdering her. Her plan backfires: Milind is the one who gets hit by her car. This causes him to have partial amnesia, where he doesn't remember his life beyond his return from Turkey. Ayesha seizes this opportunity to the fullest by encouraging Milind to avenge the Shahs through Prachi. Meanwhile, Neev ends his marriage with Ayesha, who forces him and Prachi to marry so that Milind could be hers. A date is set for the Neev/Prachi and Milind/Ayesha weddings. In spite of his seething hatred towards Prachi, Milind finds himself drawn towards her. A mutual confession follows between Milind/Prachi, after which Milind leaves Ayesha at the altar. His memory returns after Ayesha unintentionally tells him about the memories of him and Prachi which he has forgotten. Seeing that Milind/Prachi have reunited in spite of all the hurdles she created, Ayesha gives up on her quest to tear them apart.</p><p>Mallika, a businesswoman, enters the story. She is instantly smitten by Milind and thus plots to get Prachi out of the picture. Ayesha gets wind of her true intentions and warns her to stay away from Milind/Prachi. One night Mallika brings Milind to her uncle's farmhouse and tampers with his drink, making him pass out. Before she could take advantage of the situation, Ayesha shows up. The two get into a scuffle, during which Mallika stabs and kills Ayesha. Prachi learns that she is pregnant but, before she can tell Milind, she finds out that Ayesha has been murdered and Milind is arrested for it.</p><p>Mallika forces Prachi to leave Milind on the condition that she'll stand as witness and help Milind to get rid of the false accusations. After a lot of hesitation, Prachi agrees and leaves Milind to catch a train. In the meanwhile, Milind is released. Prachi humiliates him over the phone but cannot keep herself away when she comes to know that Milind has gone to visit Mallika. Milind figures out that Mallika is responsible for Prachi's sudden decision to leave him. He tries to stop Prachi but in vain. Prachi gets into a train to Kolkata. She meets a Bengali couple - Proteek Dasgupta and his wife Panchi, who are travelling with their infant.
