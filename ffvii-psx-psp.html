the PlayStation console. It is the seventh main installment in the Final Fantasy series. Published in Japan by Square, it was released in other regions by Sony Computer Entertainment and is the first in the main series with a PAL release. The game's story follows Cloud Strife, a mercenary who joins an eco-terrorist.

Enable the following code: <b>8009A05C 0041</b>. Start a new game at the 'New Game/Continue' screen, disable the code, then refer to the following guide.</p><b>Unlimited items</b><p>This trick requires the W-Item materia. The materia is obtained after your party parachutes back into Midgar in Disc 3. After entering the subway tunnels in Sector 8, your party may walk away from the screen and encounter the Turks, or walk towards the screen to reach another subway section. Select the second choice and follow the subway tunnel until it ends at a dead end with the W-Item materia.</p><p>Equip the materia on the character with the item to be duplicated. When a battle begins, select the W-Item entry on the battle menu, select an unimportant item and use it on any character. On the second item choice, select the item to be duplicated by pressing Circle, then press X to cancel your selection and increase the number of that item in inventory. Repeatedly press Circle followed by X to accumulate 99 of the duplicated item. <b>Note:</b> This will only duplicate item selectable in battle and can not be used to duplicate the various sources, materia, weapons, or armor.</p><b>Refill HP</b><p>Cast Regen-All on your party, then quickly open the PlayStation lid when all opponents have been defeated. The game will be unable to load the victory screen, and may glitch while the HP for each party member fills. After everyone is at full health, close the lid to resume the game.</p><b>Easy Battle Square handicaps</b><p>During the 'slot machine' handicap sequence, rapidly tap Square in the Battle Square section at Gold Saucer. The slots will slow down, allowing an easier selection of your handicap. <b>Note:</b> This trick will also work in a similar manner with Cait Sith's limit break.</p><b>Easy Chocobo races</b><p>While racing a Chocobo, hold R1 + R2 to slowly restore energy.</p><b>Cast magic three times at an opponent</b><p>Have all characters with Reflect status. Then, cast any attack spell on all three of your characters. The spell will bounce three times into the enemy, each with the attack power of a full spell.</p><b>Extra money</b><p>Sell a Master level All materia to get 1.4 million Gil. Since another All materia will appear when the original reaches master level, there will be no loss in usefulness.</p><b>Prevent back attacks</b><p>If a battle begins with a 'Back Attack', press L1 + R1 to turn your character around before your opponents get a shot.</p><b>Nibelheim safe combination</b><p>The combination to the safe in the old mansion in Nibelheim that contains the key to enter the basement (and get Vincent) is Right 36, Left 10, Right 59, Right 97. <b>Note:</b> Push the button used to talk to people to select each number. After opening the safe and fighting the monster inside, a key to the other part of the mansion and Odin summon materia will be found.</p><b>Finding Vincent</b><p>Take the key from the safe that contained the Odin summoning materia in Nibelheim. After defeating the Boss, Lost Number, walk down into the basement. Open the door that was previously locked (right before enter the room with Sephiroth). Talk with Vincent, after finding him inside the purple coffin. When leaving the room, he will offer to join the party.</p><b>Turtle's Paradise prizes</b><p>The Turtle's Paradise restaurant in Wutai has hidden six flyers with their advertisement in various locations. Collect all six flyers and return them to the restaurant owner to receive a prize consisting of a Power Source, Guard Source, Magic Source, Mind Source, Speed Source, Luck Source, and a Megalixer. The flyers are located in the following places:</p><ul><dt>Sector 5 slums, on the wall upstairs in a house on the east side of town.</dt><dt>Posted on the bulletin board of the lobby of Shinra HQ.</dt><dt>On the wall next to the item shop in the Ghost Hotel at Gold Saucer. </dt><dt>Attached to the wall at the Tiger Lily Arms Shop in Cosmo Canyon. </dt><dt>On the wall next to the inn keeper's desk.</dt><dt>In Yuffie's basement (next to Turtle's Paradise), check the banner on the wall outside the trap room.</dt></ul><b>Materia to beat Weapons</b><p>Use the following steps to make the battle with the Emerald and Ruby Weapons easier. <b>Note:</b> This must be done after Meteor is summoned and the Highwind is in your possession.</p><ul><p>1. Before fighting either Weapons, find and equip the Morph Matera before returning to the Undersea Reactor in Junon. Go through the sight-seeing tunnel (where the ocean can be viewed) and enter battles until the Ghost Ship appears. Use Morph when the enemy is low on HP to change them into an item called 'Guide Book'.</p><p>2. Leave Junon and return to Kalm. Go to the last house on the right, next to the bar. Go upstairs, where an old man will be encountered. He will explain how he wants to understand the afterlife, and ask you to find three items: Guide Book, Earth Harp, and Desert Rose. He will notice that you already have Guide Book and give you the Underwater Materia.</p><p>3. Equip the Underwater Materia. It does not gain AP and will not duplicate. This Materia removes the time limit when Emerald Weapon is encountered.</p><p>4. Defeat Emerald Weapon (a few mastered Mime and Knights of the Round will be helpful) to receive Earth Harp. Take it back to Kalm and give it to the old man to receive Master Summon (Red), Master Magic (Green), and Master Command (Yellow) Materia. These Materia can not level up or duplicate, but have all the abilities of their single counterparts. Master Summon grants all Summons for as long as MP are available. A similar effect is also used by Master Magic. Master Command is a little difficult to work with, but is still worth it.</p><p>5. Equip the new Materia and ram into Ruby, who is minding its own business in Gold Saucer. With luck, the single character Ruby allows to stay and fight will be ready to deal with this massacre.</p><p>6. Defeat Ruby and take Desert Rose to the man in Kalm to receive a Gold Chocobo. You probably will already have one, as Knights Of The Round is required for the Weapons battles. A good combo to use against the Weapons is HP Absorb + Knights (mega damage and mega boost in HP).</p></ul><b>Easier Ruby Weapon battle</b><p>Kill two members of your party before fighting Ruby Weapon. Have the Summon Phoenix materia equipped on the remaining character, then run into Ruby Weapon. When fighting, Ruby will only attack the live character, and therefore not use the Quicksand attack. Wait until the Weapon sticks his claws in the ground. Then, use Summon Phoenix to attack it and revive the dead party members. All three party members are now available for the battle.</p><p>Another strategy is to have all characters equipped with the Final Attack + Revive or Phoenix materia combination. Have one character equipped with a weapon or armor containing Knights Of The Round + MP Turbo. Also have a Mastered Magic Plus materia (not MP Plus) somewhere else in the weapon or armor of each character. Have all three people wear the Mystile armor (first from Midgar Raid, second from North Cave, third from Ultimate Weapon when it is over Midgar). This will prevent Ruby's Ultima attack from injuring your characters. Kill two characters, then enter the battle with Ruby Weapon. When the Weapon's claws are in the ground, revive the two dead characters, and have W-Summon cast Knights Of The Round and have the other two characters Mime. This will hit Ruby Weapon for 9999 damage each time. It should be defeated after eight to ten rounds of this type of attack.</p><p>Another strategy is to kill two of your characters, then equip the following materia combination: HP Absorb + Knights Of The Round, W-Summon, Mime. Use a hero drink, then summon the Knights Of The Round. Each time he/she will gain over 9,000 HP points. Then, simply Mime this attack until the Weapon is defeated.</p><p>Another strategy is to use Mime in addition to the Final Attack + Phoenix materia combination. Get Cloud's limit bar full, and start the battle. Ruby will take your other two characters away with Quicksand. Attack with Omnislash. At Cloud's next turn, select Mimic and Cloud will use the Omnislash again. Repeat this attack. The only drawback to this strategy, is the need for a little bit in the limit meter. Without it, Cloud will jump forward after a brief flash, and Ruby Weapon will attack. When Cloud does the limit, the game will act as though you had a full limit bar, and delete all that remains in it. To effectively make this trick work, make sure Ruby Weapon hits Cloud before doing the Omnislash again.</p><b>Easier Emerald Weapon battle</b><p>Equip a member of your party with a Gravity materia, at any level. It will hit the Emerald Weapon for 9,999 damage. Using this and the Quad-Magic combo can take almost 40,000 hit points from one attack round alone.</p><p>Another strategy is to equip the following materia combination: HP Absorb + Knights Of The Round, W-Summon, Mime, Underwater (and nothing else). Use a hero drink, then summon the Knights Of The Round. Each time he/she will gain over 9,000 HP points. Then, simply Mime this attack until the Weapon is defeated. Keep your materia number as low as possible, the more materia equipped, the more the Weapon's Air Tam Stomp will effect the party. For example, if four materia are equipped the Air Tam Stomp will take off 4444 HP points, five materia will result in 5555 HP points and so on.</p><b>Extra Gil</b><p>When at the Gold Saucer Prison, go out in the desert and fight a enemy called Cactuar. Defeat him to get 10,000 Gil. This creature can also be found at Cactuar Island on the south-east area of the map, or south of Cosmo Canyon.</p><b>Exchange Gil for GP</b><p>When at Gold Saucer go through the welcome sign then come back out again. Keep on doing this until a man appears in the far background, near the save location. Approach him, and he will ask if you want to change Gil into GP. Answer yes to trade up to 10,00 Gil into 100 GP.</p><b>Key to Sector 5</b><p>Late in the game, go to the Number 7 gate at Midgar. A man outside the door will say that he lost his key to the city at an excavation site. The only excavation site is at Bone Village. Go there and talk to the man that asks about what you are searching. Reply 'normal treasure' and place your excavators on the upper area. Eventually, a box will turn up after multiple digs. Search it in the morning to find the key.</p><b>Cloud mercenary flashback</b><p>After Cloud has had his coma, go to the basement at the Shinra Mansion. Enter the library and Cloud have a flashback and remember how he became a mercenary.</p><b>Back room of Cosmo Canyon General Store</b><p>The General store in Cosmo Canyon has a back room that is roped off when your characters first arrive. Check back after Meteor has been summoned. The rope will be gone, allowing your characters to walk back in the room and get an Elixir, Magic Source, and the 'Full Cure' Materia.</p><b>Sleeping old man</b><p>Directly East of Junon is a small cave that is only accessible using the Highwind or riding on a blue/gold Chocobo. The old man in the cave can tell you how many times your party has fought or escaped. You can also get helpful items from him, but the last two digits in the times you have fought must be the same. For instance, speaking to him after you have fought 699 times may get you the Bolt Ring.</p><b>Date with Tifa</b><p>Never talk to Aeris unless it is vital for progression of the game. Then, Cloud will get a date with Tifa after Aeris dies.</p><b>Date with Barret</b><p>Never talk to Aeris or Tifa unless it is vital for progression for the game. Then, once Kalm has entered for the first time, Barret will ask Cloud for a date.</p><b>Bahamnant ZERO Summon Materia details</b><p>Walk around after boarding the Shinra No. 26 spaceship on disc two. Your party will be able to go down to the space pod or up the ladder to the right to the huge materia. Go to the huge materia and use the talk button at the tall glass to speak with Cid. He will explain the controls in this part of the game. Talk again at the case and enter the password Circle, Square, X, X to collect the Key Item 'Huge Materia'. After travelling to Cosmo Canyon later in the game, talk to Bugenhagen. He will take your party up to his observatory. Approach to the Blue huge materia and get closer. Your party will receive the Bahamnant ZERO summon materia.</p><b>Easy Power Source for super strength</b><img src='https://r.mprd.se/fup/up/52197-Final_Fantasy_VII_(E)_(Disc_1)-1.png' alt='Psp' title='Psp' /><p>Go to the meltdown reactor at Gonganga town. Then, get into a battle with a Heavy Tank. Morph it to get a Power Source to build your strength up by a point. Repeat this as needed to build as much strength as needed.</p><b>Status display</b><p>The highest number shown on the status menu is 255. However, the game will allow items on that screen to be built higher, but will not display anything greater than that number.</p><b>Extra Ribbons</b><p>Go to Geas Cliff. In the first cave after wrapping around to the bridge overlooking the door that was used to enter, walk straight to enter a cave with a box. Open it to find a ribbon.

Its inheritors and improved models: Net Yaroze, PSone, PSX, PocketStation, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3. On 31 of March 2005 the sales of PlayStation and PSone has reached the level of 102.49 million units, until then, not a single game console could pass the 100 million sales! PlayStation Release has stopped only on 23 of March, 2006, since the release of the first console has been more than 11 years. Japan, Europe and the United States proclaimed PlayStation as a game console of the next generation. Soon the teen gaming audience, so thoroughly cared by Nintendo, decided to try PlayStation. Even the true lovers and fans of Nintendo, who were desperately waiting for the Nintendo 64, have bought a PlayStation and have been very satisfied. Given that by the end of 1996 a collection of games for the PSX numbered nearly 200 units.</p><h3 id='psx-psp-roms'>Psx Psp Roms</h3><p>Today, PlayStation roms games are very popular and can be played on home computers or modern tablets and smartphones with android and ios system.
